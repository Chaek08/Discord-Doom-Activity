### How? 🤔
* Using Discord's new [Activities](https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/overview "Activities") + [Embedded App SDK](https://discord.com/developers/docs/developer-tools/embedded-app-sdk "Embedded App SDK")
* Combined with Alexander Guryanov ([caiiiycuk](https://github.com/caiiiycuk "caiiiycuk"))'s fantastic [js-dos](https://github.com/caiiiycuk/js-dos "js-dos") project
* Powered by the old saying "If it can run Doom, it must run Doom"

### Why? 🙋‍♂️
It started with me just wanting to explore the new Activities & Embedded App SDK, and see what was possible. I of course then got the funny idea to see if it was possible to run Doom inside the new Discord Activities.

### So, what's going on? 🧑‍🏫
Using a modified version of js-dos & the original Doom (1993) files, it is pretty easy to get the fundamentals up and running inside Discord.
Tweak the performance a little, and maybe add some new features using the different APIs we've just been given access to - or whatever you have in mind.

### What's next? 🔮
* Easy online gaming by combining Discord's API's for multiplayer instances with the networking features  of js-dos.
* More streamlined, universal emulator for JS-DOS (Like Dos-Zone) with community inspiried features (eg: mods, homebrew, etc) with deep Discord community integrations (eg: Leaderboards, Server-wide / Channel specefic multiplayer)
